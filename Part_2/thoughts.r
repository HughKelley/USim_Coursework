# Part 2 requirements 

# 1) explain the different models briefly, mainly stating in which situations you would use them. 
# unconstrained, 
# production
# attraction
# doubly constrained models, 


2) explain the role of the parameters briefly. 

In section 3) select a scenario and using the practical given to you in class, 
explore the consequences of varying some of the model parameters and inputs, on
both interaction flows and the origin or destination estimates produced by the model.
